About the data
--------------
-------------

Temporal data are data types that changes over time, in other words Temporal data is time-series data,  this 
data is collected as time progresses. Modeling temporal data is one of the fundamental tasks in machine
learning since many systems keep track of signals that are changing over time.


Describe the data
--------------------
My work here contains some generated  data used to perform  feature engineering, this involves some
process in order to bring out qaulity in time-series data. I converted timestamps into differents timezones and perform
some more convrsions. Go through it eagerly.
